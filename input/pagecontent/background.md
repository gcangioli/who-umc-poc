IDMP – Identification of Medicinal Products – is a set of five standards developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to create a universal framework of structured, coded data that uniquely identify and describe all key aspects of medicinal products.

The focus on this Implementation Guide is on two parts of the ISO IDMP standard, the Pharmaceutical Product Identifier (PhPID) and the Global Substance Identifier (GSID):
