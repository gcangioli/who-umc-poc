## Authentication
The PhPIDs (APD) and GSIDs (SD) is publicly available. Requesting new PhPS and GSIDs requires authentication and the access to detailed drug information through the MedicinalProductDefinition API requires a special license. It is also only possible to request the status of a request (Task) for tasks generated using the same authentication credentials.

It is possible to search APDs using MPD attriutes, like MPD identifier, without a license to retrieve the actual MPD.

Some information/attributes on the SD that is not within the public domain also requires a special license.
